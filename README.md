## Online_Book_Reader

My first OOP Educational console project made using C++.
The project does not have many functionalities. The main purpose of it was to enhance my designing skills and thinking in object oriented method , although it was the biggest project i do so far based on number of lines of codes.

The application system has two kinds of users:
1-Admins: who can add books to the system
2-Users: who read these different books in reading sessions based system

There is the possibility to save the data of every reading session for every user and continue it later.
